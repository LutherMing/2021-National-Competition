## üèÜ National Competition
- The National Competition, also known as the National University Student Mathematical Modeling Competition, is an annual event held in China. It is the largest and most prestigious mathematical modeling competition for university students in the country. 

- The competition is open to all undergraduate students in China. Teams of three students work together to solve a set of mathematical modeling problems over a period of four days. The problems are typically based on real-world scenarios and require students to apply their mathematical knowledge and skills to develop solutions

## Restatement of the Problem

### 1. Problem Background:
- A production company specializing in construction and decorative panel materials utilizes three main types of raw materials: A, B, and C.
- The company operates on a 48-week production schedule and needs to plan raw material procurement and transportation 24 weeks in advance.
- This involves selecting raw material suppliers ("Suppliers"), determining the weekly order quantities ("Order Quantity"), selecting a third-party logistics company ("Carrier") to transport the weekly material supply from suppliers to the company's warehouse.

### 2. Known Information:
- **Production:** The company's weekly production capacity is 2.82 million cubic meters. Each cubic meter of product requires 0.6 cubic meters of type A material, 0.66 cubic meters of type B material, or 0.72 cubic meters of type C material.
- **Supply:** Suppliers may deliver more or less than the ordered quantity due to the nature of the materials. The company maintains a minimum inventory level to meet two weeks of production needs.
- **Transportation:** Materials experience a certain loss during transportation (loss rate as a percentage of the supplied quantity). Each Carrier has a weekly transportation capacity of 6000 cubic meters.
- **Cost:** Type A and B materials have purchase prices 20% and 10% higher than type C material. Transportation and storage costs are uniform for all material types.

### 3. Problem Statement:
Based on the provided information and datasets, establish a mathematical model to address the following four main issues:
1. Quantitatively analyze the supply characteristics of 402 suppliers and identify the top 50 most crucial suppliers for ensuring production continuity.
2. Determine the minimum number of suppliers needed to meet production requirements, develop cost-effective material ordering plans for the next 24 weeks, and devise transportation plans with minimal losses.
3. Develop new ordering and transportation plans to maximize purchases of type A and minimize purchases of type C materials while minimizing Carrier transportation losses. Analyze the implementation effects of these plans.
4. Determine the maximum potential increase in the company's weekly production capacity and provide material ordering and transportation plans for the next 24 weeks.


## Solution
### Summary:
The paper discusses the optimization of supply chain management for companies dealing with procurement and transportation of raw materials, which emphasizes strategic planning, data analysis, and evaluation methods to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.



1. **Problem Statement:**
